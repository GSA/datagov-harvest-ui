# Datagov Harvest UI

This repository holds the code for Data.gov's Harvest 2.0 UI Reporting Front-End.

It is built from the ground up with the following technologies:
- SveleteKit ([link](https://kit.svelte.dev/))
- USWDS ([link](https://designsystem.digital.gov/))
- Chart.js ([link](https://www.chartjs.org/))

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
